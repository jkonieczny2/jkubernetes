### Delete resource stuck in pending

Most likely you need to remove the finalizers, which only allow deletion when certain conditions met.

First edit the resource:

kubectl edit pvc/pgdata-miller-construction-pg-cluster-0 -n postgres-operator

Remove the 'finalizers' section; then you should be able to delete
